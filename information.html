  <h1>The beginnings</h1>

  <p>The Beatles began their journey in the late 1950s in Liverpool, England, when John Lennon formed a skiffle group called The Quarrymen. Soon, Paul McCartney joined the band, followed by George Harrison. The trio, with a passion for rock 'n' roll, honed their skills playing at local clubs. After several lineup changes and the addition of drummer Ringo Starr in 1962, the band solidified its classic lineup. Their relentless touring in Hamburg and Liverpool, coupled with their tight harmonies and catchy songs, laid the groundwork for what would become a groundbreaking career in music history.</p>
